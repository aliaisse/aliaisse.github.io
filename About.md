I am a PhD candidate in Security Studies, International Relations and Strategic Studies at Princeton University. In 2025-2026, I will be a Visiting Scholar in the Nuclear Security Program at the MacMillan Center, Yale University. My research lies at the intersection of international security, nuclear politics and foreign policy decision-making, specifically examining nuclear deterrence, coercive diplomacy, and U.S. grand strategy.
