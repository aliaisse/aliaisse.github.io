## Research Focus
I study coercive statecraft and counterproliferation. My dissertation models how states choose among diplomacy and preventive force to forestall nuclear acquisition, emphasizing time horizons (“time-to-bomb”) and leaders’ latitude to escalate.

## Dissertation Project
**Working title:** *Strategies of Coercion in the Nuclear Era*  
**Question:** Under what conditions do states sustain coercive diplomacy, select preventive force, or adopt strategic restraint when confronting an advancing nuclear program?  
**Design:** Multi-archival case studies (Libya, Iraq, Iran, North Korea) plus an original episode dataset (1950–2017), and Statistical Analysis

## Selected Writing
- “Coercion and Prevention on a Single Continuum” (prospectus, 2025).  
- “Windows, Latitude, and the Choice for Prevention” (working paper).

## Teaching / Service
- Research Design and Methods Reading (Fall 2024)
- International Organizations (Spring 2025)
