## Research Focus
I study coercive statecraft and counterproliferation. My dissertation examines how states choose between sustaining diplomacy, opting for preventive force, or adopting strategic restraint when confronting an advancing nuclear program.

## Dissertation Project
**Working title:** *Strategies of Coercion in the Nuclear Era*  
**Question:** What determines whether leaders sustain coercive diplomacy, select preventive force, or adopt strategic restraint?  
**Design:** Multi-archival case studies (Libya, Iraq, Iran, North Korea) plus an original episode dataset (1950–2017).

## Selected Writing
- “Coercion and Prevention on a Single Continuum” (prospectus, 2025)  
- “Windows, Latitude, and the Choice for Prevention” (working paper)
